Once you have those things you can go to the following link and [submit a ticket to the IACS Support Center](https://iacs.supportsystem.com/index.php). You'll want to press 'open new ticket', fill in your information, and select 'Request an account for Seawulf' in the help topics section.

To do this you start not logged in to regular seawulf. So, from your normal computer, log in using the normal login procedure but instead of 'ssh -X' use 'sftp'.

    "The easiest way to make a script file is to make a copy of one and edit it. If you've downloaded QuEP through Evan Trommer's GitHub there should be a folder called Old-Scripts. I find this easiest to do in vs code. All you need to do is find an old script file, right click to copy, then paste. Edit the contents to include your own job name, output file name, and your own email. You may also need to edit the nodes, time, and partition (-p) but since those require a bit more information they will be covered in their own section. Once your file has been edited to your liking you can transfer it to seawulf using the same process as was discussed in the **Transfering files to seawulf** section above.\n",
    "### Nodes, time, and partition\n",
    "Seawulf is a computer cluster; This just means it's a bunch of computers that are able to work together to run complicated jobs. The 'nodes' refers to the number of computers that will be running your job. The amount you can put for this is directly related to the partition you choose. Seawulf has a site that provides [information on the qualities and types of partitions](https://it.stonybrook.edu/help/kb/seawulf-queues) that can be helpful. The bare minimum to know is that for whichever partition you pick, you must pick a number of nodes and a time that falls within the minimums and maximums shown on the charts.<br>\n",
    "I think I should include stuff on the shared nodes but I feel like I don't actually understand those. SO what do I still feel like I need to know about them? How to login, IN GENERAL how to understand how much power you may actually need for each job and how to know what partition that correlates with, why are the milan ones in a different section, what does gpu mean, "
